  <p>Color can be just as important as a logo in identifying a brand, and is perhaps the most important tool for conveying a brand's attitude. Cooler colors like blue, for example, are often used to convey friendliness and calm; warmer colors such as red are used to indicate energy and passion.</p>

    <h2>Palette</h2>
    <p>Our main accent color is an exceptionally calm dark cyan â€“ PMS 632 C (<code>#0091b2</code> on the web). This color was chosen because of that calmness, but also because of it's emotional warmth and stability.</p>
    <p>The palette also includes a yellow (PMS 108 C / <code>#ffdb00</code>) & green (PMS 368 C / <code>#77bc1f</code>) for use as secondary colors, and a not-quite-black (PMS Black 3 C / <code>#212620</code>) for text.</p>
    <p>The blue, yellow, and green each have 5 shades, two lighter and two darker than the main shade. These are for illustration and background purposes only, and should not be used on text or the logo.</p>
