# Typography

If you look at the <a data-scroll href="#color-combinations">color combinations</a> above, you may notice that the examples look remarkably alike, despite being (mostly) different colors. This is because Sea of Green follows a set of strict typography rules.

## Font Families

The first of these rules is the font families we use. Keeping the typeface selection consistent is just as important as using the same colors and logo; it is just as recognizable as those elements. Consistency causes internalization, and there's no place better to inspire that internalization than the words a user or customer is reading.

### Heading Text

For headers, we use a typeface called [ATC Overlook](https://avondaletypeco.com/atc-overlook/). Unfortunately, this font family is not available in Google Docs or for widespread distribution. We are working on a sign-making web application, but in the mean time you can [contact us](mailto:alec@sea-of-green.com) for use in Microsoft Office products.

### Body Text

Body text is set in [Droid Serif](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Droid+Serif). Droid Serif features a large x-height, open counters, and slightly condensed letterforms that makes it very easy to read at even small sizes. In addition, it's open source and available in Google Docs, which makes it ideal for widespread use throughout the company. [Here is a guide for adding fonts to your Google Docs documents](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/189190?hl=en).

## Type Size

Size is another very important factor in maintaining consistency. Size, in this case, is defined as a combination of the font size, line-spacing (vertical rhythm), and font weight.

### Font Size

Font size is determined using a modular scale. This is a technique that uses a ratio to determine a series of numbers that is used for sizing elements, the most famous example of which is the [golden ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_ratio). The ratio we use is called the augmented fourth, or ```1.414```. Below is the sizes we generally use, but as long as an augmented fourth scale is used any base font size is OK. [Here is a tool you can use to find the correct sequence based on any base font size](http://www.modularscale.com/?11&pt&1.414&web&table). Not that some values will need to be rounded.

|               | Web                    | Print      | Large Print | Huge Print  |
|--------------:|:----------------------:|:----------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| **Heading 1** | ```45px (2.8725rem)``` | ```31pt``` | ```68pt```  | ```102pt``` |
| **Heading 2** | ```32px (1.9994rem)``` | ```22pt``` | ```48pt```  | ```72pt```  |
| **Heading 3** | ```23px (1.414rem)```  | ```16pt``` | ```34pt```  | ```51pt```  |
| **Heading 4** | ```16px (1rem)```      | ```11pt``` | ```24pt```  | ```36pt```  |
| **Base**      | ```16px (1rem)```      | ```11pt``` | ```24pt```  | ```36pt```  |

### Line Spacing

Vertical rhythm is a huge influencer on the way text is read. It's important to give individual lines of text enough room to be read comfortably. For our part, we lay out all text on a baseline determined by the base font size (the number you use to determine heading sizes above) multiplied by ```1.75```. For example, our web typography is laid out on a ```28px (1.75rem)``` baseline. Of course, headings two and three are too large to fit on that baseline, so they take up two lines, or ```56px (3.5rem)```. For print, that would be ```19pt``` & ```38pt```, respectively. Below, you can see this represented visually.

<section class="type__lines">
  <div class="type__block type__h1">Heading 1</div>
  <div class="type__block type__h2">Heading 2</div>
  <div class="type__block type__h3">Heading 3</div>
  <div class="type__block type__h4">Heading 4</div>
  <p class="type__block ">A vise is a heinous shovel. The loaded engine reveals itself as an afire island to those who look. A station of the colt is assumed to be a hefty tenor. However, a trouser can hardly be considered an untamed golf without also being a retailer.</p>
  <p class="type__block ">A clayey jail's horn comes with it the thought that the jugal column is a granddaughter. We know that a transport can hardly be considered a killing hydrant without also being a border. The literature would have us believe that a setose philosophy is not but a period. A moneyed health without juices is truly a carp of fiercest romanians.</p>

### Font Weight

Rounding out font sizes, consistent application of weights is also hugely important. Luckily, it's also the easiest of the three principals to apply. Below is a table that shows the weights at the font sizes from above. Note that on dark backgrounds, you may want to bump the weight up one notch, e.g. Medium (500) to Semi-bold (600).

| Heading 1  | Heading 2  | Heading 3    | Heading 4    | Base          |
|------------|------------|--------------|--------------|---------------|
| Bold (700) | Bold (700) | Medium (500) | Medium (500) | Regular (400) |
