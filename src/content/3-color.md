# Color

Color can be just as important as a logo in identifying a brand, and is perhaps the most important tool for conveying a brand's attitude. Cooler colors like blue, for example, are often used to convey friendliness and calm; warmer colors such as red are used to indicate energy and passion.

## Palette

Our main accent color is an exceptionally calm dark cyan â€“ PMS 632 C (```#0091b2``` on the web). This color was chosen because of that calmness, but also because of it's emotional warmth and stability.

The palette also includes a yellow (PMS 108 C / ```#ffdb00```) & green (PMS 368 C / ```#77bc1f```) for use as secondary colors, and a not-quite-black (PMS Black 3 C / ```#212620```) for text.

The blue, yellow, and green each have 5 shades, two lighter and two darker than the main shade. These are for illustration and background purposes only, and should not be used on text or the logo.

## Color Combinations

It's important for the colors we use to be presented consistently, and in the most accessible way possible. There are several common color combinations we use at Sea of Green, all based off of our color palette. Of course, you are not limited to these color combinations. Any color combination using our palette is fine for illustrations, for example. For text-based applications, however, one of the below combinations should probably be used. If you *must* use a separate combination, it should first be checked against WebAIM's [Color Contrast Checker](http://webaim.org/resources/contrastchecker/) to ensure that the colors have enough contrast to be viewed by the widest audience possible.

Here are the most common color combinations we use:

### Default (White)

| Background            | Headers & Links           | Text                          |
|-----------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|
| White / ```#ffffff``` | PMS 632 C / ```#0091b2``` | PMS Black 3 C / ```#212620``` |

  <span class="color__combo-subhead">Sub Header</span>
  <p>A vise is a heinous shovel. The loaded engine reveals itself as an afire island to those who look. A station of the colt is <a href="#">assumed to be a hefty tenor</a>. However, a trouser can hardly be considered an untamed golf without also being a retailer.</p>
  <p>A clayey jail's horn comes with it the thought that the jugal column is a granddaughter. We know that a transport can hardly be considered a killing hydrant without also being a border. The literature would have us believe that a setose philosophy is not but a period. A moneyed health without juices is truly a carp of fiercest romanians.</p>
