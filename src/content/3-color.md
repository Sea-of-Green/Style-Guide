# Color

Color can be just as important as a logo in identifying a brand, and is perhaps the most important tool for conveying a brand's attitude. Cooler colors like blue, for example, are often used to convey friendliness and calm; warmer colors such as red are used to indicate energy and passion.

## Palette

Our main accent color is an exceptionally calm dark cyan â€“ PMS 632 C (```#0091b2``` on the web). This color was chosen because of that calmness, but also because of it's emotional warmth and stability.

The palette also includes a yellow (PMS 108 C / ```#ffdb00```) & green (PMS 368 C / ```#77bc1f```) for use as secondary colors, and a not-quite-black (PMS Black 3 C / ```#212620```) for text.

The blue, yellow, and green each have 5 shades, two lighter and two darker than the main shade. These are for illustration and background purposes only, and should not be used on text or the logo.
