## Photos

Photography is a very powerful medium. It can invoke emotion and ideas in a way few other things can. Unfortunately, it's also very visually distracting if used improperly. At Sea of Green, we have a few very basic rules to avoid that.

### Photography as Image

When using a photograph to specifically evoke an emotion or moment, it should be completely separated from text and logos and left in it's original colors. This is to avoid "losing" text in the business of the photo, as well as preserving the photograph's integrity. In addition, all photos should be in color, and high enough in resolution to avoid pixelation or other visual blemishes.

<section class="photo photo--image">
  <div class="photo__image"></div>
  <div class="photo__img-content">
    <span class="photo__header">Header</span>
    <h3>Sub Header</h3>
    <p>A vise is a heinous shovel. The loaded engine reveals itself as an afire island to those who look. A station of the colt is <a href="#">assumed to be a hefty tenor</a>. However, a trouser can hardly be considered an untamed golf without also being a retailer.</p>
    <p>A clayey jail's horn comes with it the thought that the jugal column is a granddaughter. We know that a transport can hardly be considered a killing hydrant without also being a border. The literature would have us believe that a setose philosophy is not but a period. A moneyed health without juices is truly a carp of fiercest romanians.</p>

### Photography as Background

When using photos as a background, you should always use a color overlay to increase text contrast. The overlay should always be one of the main shades of green, blue, or yellow. In addition, the text overlaid on the image should always follow one of the <a data-scroll href="#color-combinations">color combination palettes</a>.

### Photograph Sourcing

Ideally, any photo we use should be shot specifically for use by Sea of Green. Unfortunately, that is not always a viable option for various reasons. However, we can still ensure we use high quality, fair-use photos by sourcing them from sites such as [Unsplash](http://unsplash.com) or [FindA.Photo](http://finda.photo).

## Patterns

Currently, there is only one official pattern. It is built out of the Sea of Green icon, and often applied at a 32&deg; angle. As with photography, text should never be laid directly over text.

#### Icon Pattern

#### Rotated Icon Pattern

## Illustration

Sea of Green uses a few specific rules for illustration. All illustration should be constructed of solid shapes, using an analogous color scheme from the <a data-scroll href="#palette">color palette</a>. Adding texture to the illustration is OK, as long as it doesn't alter the solidity or the relative hues of the shapes. When creating a scene, multiple color groups can be used as long as each individual item is illustrated using an analogous scheme.
