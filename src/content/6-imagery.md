## Photos

### Photography as Image

<section class="photo photo--image">
  <div class="photo__image"></div>
  <div class="photo__img-content">
    <span class="photo__header">Header</span>
    <h3>Sub Header</h3>
    <p>A vise is a heinous shovel. The loaded engine reveals itself as an afire island to those who look. A station of the colt is <a href="#">assumed to be a hefty tenor</a>. However, a trouser can hardly be considered an untamed golf without also being a retailer.</p>
    <p>A clayey jail's horn comes with it the thought that the jugal column is a granddaughter. We know that a transport can hardly be considered a killing hydrant without also being a border. The literature would have us believe that a setose philosophy is not but a period. A moneyed health without juices is truly a carp of fiercest romanians.</p>

### Photography as Background

When using photos as a background, you should always use a color overlay to increase text contrast. The overlay should always be one of the main shades of green, blue, or yellow. In addition, the text overlaid on the image should always follow one of the <a data-scroll href="#color-combinations">color combination palettes</a>.
