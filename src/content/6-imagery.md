# Imagery

## Photos

### Photography as Image

### Photography as Background

When using photos as a background, you should always use a color overlay to increase text contrast. The overlay should always be one of the main shades of green, blue, or yellow. In addition, the text overlaid on the image should always follow one of the <a href="#color-combinations">color combination palettes</a>.

## Patterns

Currently, there is only one official pattern. It is often applied at a 32&deg; angle.
