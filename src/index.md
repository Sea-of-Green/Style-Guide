### A Brand is Way More Than a Logo

Think about Coca-Cola. What does it look like? It probably looks to you like it does to me: white script on a red label on the most recognizably unique bottle on Earth. It might look like a red can or a fuzzy brown liquid in a top-heavy glass, but the point remains the same: you can conjure up an image of Coca-Cola in your head.

This is because Coca-Cola, or Coke, has one of the most recognizable brands in the world. You know exactly what the Coca-Cola logo looks like, even if you can’t draw it. And it extends beyond the logo too: you know the shade of red, the shape of the bottles and glasses, you know the tone of voice.

All of those things represent the Coke brand. And they’re applied consistently. You’ll never see a blue Coke can, or at the least you’d be very shocked if you did. That’s why you can picture Coke in your head: they helped you draw the picture.
