# Copywriting Voice

The Sea of Green voice should be friendly and knowledgeable. The writer should assume that the reader is a complete novice in gardening, but intelligent. Industry specific terms, abbreviations, and jargon should be avoided or explained. Explanations of techniques or scientific processes should not be overly technical, rather the writer should write about these processes in layman's terms. Referring to specific products is encouraged, as long as the product is mentioned in appropriate context (and linked to our store!).

### Examples

<blockquote>
  <p>During the day, plants absorb CO<sub>2</sub> through thousands of stoma on the surface of its leaves and stores it in the plant for later processing. Because this process is very energy intensive, the plant will crave additional light and nutrients. It is often said that CO<sub>2</sub> controls a plant's metabolism for this reason.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Make sure to research the specific lighting needs of your plants. <a href="http://www.sea-of-green.com/lighting/fluorescent-and-led/">LEDs (Light Emitting Diodes)</a> are a fast growing lighting option, and may be ideal for your tent space. They run cooler than standard <a href="http://www.sea-of-green.com/lighting/grow-lamps-and-bulbs/">HID (High Intensity Discharge) lamps</a>, but don’t have the intense light that some plants thrive under. For those plants, the HID lamps are generally a better option.</p>

  <p>Silica’s natural alkalinity also makes it an ideal solution for mold and powdery mildew. Spraying silica on the foliage will raise the pH on the surface of the plant, preventing the kind of environment in which mold thrives.</p>
